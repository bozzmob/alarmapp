# Alarm App

This is a simple Alarm application(no sound yet!). You can set alarms, edit them and delete them.

A small webapp based on HTML5 and JS.

Abstraction and Encapsulation concepts can be well seen in this example


##To Do:
Multiple edits should be handled. Right now, multiple edits cause the existing alarm(in edit state) to be overriden and ultimately we loose the current alarm in edit state.
